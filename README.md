# INDUSTRY-TALK-2

## What I gain from the talk :
About system development. System development including the process of designing, implementing and managing complex software and information systems. From Ms. Qistina's talk, she mentioned data analytics is essential to system development. It will help system developers to design optimization, performance validation, user experience enhancement and iterative enhancements based on user feedback. Ms. Qistina also focused on some of the technology and tools that they used every day in credence such as Superset, PowerBI, Metabase, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Druid, Spark, Airflow and programming languages such as Bash, Python and SQL. From the talk, I gained some advice which is I need to update the newest technology, work in teams, and enhance my soft skills and programming skills.

## Improvement :
In my point of view, I think I need to improve my communication skills to enable me to articulate my ideas and thoughts clearly. This is essential during project discussions to ensure that each of my members understands my perspectives, goals and ideas.

## Others : 
As Ms. Qistina advised, continuous learning is crucial. I do consider exploring online courses, workshops, or resources about data analytics tools and trends used in system development.
